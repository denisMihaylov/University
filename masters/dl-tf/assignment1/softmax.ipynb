    "**Your answer:** The matrix $W$ is initialized with random weights. The softmax function returns the probability distribution of the classes given the weights and the training examples. This means that with random weights we would expect that the probability of any of the classes is $1 / n$ (равновероятни са). In our case we have 10 classes so this probability will be $0.1$. The loss function is exactly the sum over all examples of $-log(p_{y_{i}})$, where $y_{i}$ is the probability of the \"true\" class for the given example - in our case that would be $0.1$. We make the sum ot this and devide it over the number of the training examples and we get $-log(0.1)$\n"
